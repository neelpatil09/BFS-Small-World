Mini-project to demonstrate the use of Breadth First Search. Given two actors/actresses, the program will find the quickest link between them (Actor A worked with Actor B on Movie 1... Actor B worked with Actor C on Movie 2... so on until the target is found). Done using over 4 million actors/actresses and their movies from IMDb in CS 114 at NJIT as a project.
